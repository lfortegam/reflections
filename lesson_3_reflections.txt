When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  To share my repository with other people so that they can work in my project too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Following the idea of manually commit, it helps to keep the control over our work.
